# Guardian
A free, open-source, and feature-rich modification for the Attack on Titan Tribute Game.

## Where do I get/download Guardian Mod?
Download "[ModLauncher.exe](https://aottgfan.site/clients/guardian/ModLauncher.exe)" and run it!
    - If Windows Smart Defender stops the launcher from running, click "More Info" and then click "Run Anyway", this is an issue I can not/will not fix as I do not sign the executable.

## Features
This mod has (almost) everything RiceCake's mod (RC mod) has, and much more!

- Improved protection against abusive users!
    - Mod detection could be categorized under this, but I see it as more of a for-fun thing.
- A touched up in-game user-interface.
- In-game Voice Chat!
    - `V` to talk, baskslash (`\`) to open the configuration menu.
- Custom textures/sounds!
    - Help on these are available in the `README.TXT` file found when you download and run Guardian's launcher, or when you extract the ZIP file.
- A *boat-load* of new settings (ESCAPE key to open the configuration menu):
