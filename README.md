# Guardian
A free, open-source, and feature-rich modification for the Attack on Titan Tribute Game.

## Where do I get/download Guardian Mod?
Download "[ModLauncher.exe](https://aottgfan.site/clients/guardian/ModLauncher.exe)" and run it!
    - If Windows Smart Defender stops the launcher from running, click "More Info" and then click "Run Anyway", this is an issue I can not/will not fix as I do not sign the executable.

## Features
This mod has (almost) everything RiceCake's mod (RC mod) has, and much more!

- Improved protection against abusive users!
    - Mod detection could be categorized under this, but I see it as more of a for-fun thing.
- A touched up in-game user-interface.
- In-game Voice Chat!
    - `V` to talk, baskslash (`\`) to open the configuration menu.
- Custom textures/sounds!
    - Help on these are available in the `README.txt` file found when you download and run Guardian's launcher, or when you extract the ZIP file.
- A plethora of new settings (ESCAPE key to open the configuration menu)
    - View ALL of them at [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md)
- New Gamemodes
    - **Time-Bomb** - Kill titans to gain time and stay alive!
    - **Last Man Standing** - The last player with the most kills after each wave wins!
    - **Cage Fight** - Two players, two titans, each titan kill causes the opposing side to have another titan that they need to kill. Whoever dies first loses.
        - A ground-up re-creation of Feng's Cage Fight gamemode that had been long gone.
- New Map Options
    - These maps require Guardian to host/join, excluding Anarchy-Custom.
    - **The City II** (The City with 10s Respawn)
    - **The City IV** (The Forest II, but in The City)
    - **The City V** (The Forest III, but in The City)
    - **Multi-Map** (Allows you to change the map while in a room)
    - **Anarchy-Custom Map** (Custom Maps with support for Anarchy's racing objects/scripts)
- Improved/Fixed Functions
    - "Quickmatch" button now acts as a way to enter "Offline Mode".
- Notable and/or more Technical Changes
    - Ability to switch between a UDP or TCP connection to [Photon](https://photonengine.com/)

## Special Thanks
- [Fenglee](http://fenglee.com/), without you, we wouldn't have the [base game](http://fenglee.com/game/aog/) that we all know and love.
- [RiceCake](https://github.com/rc174945), this mod probably wouldn't even be a thing if [RC](https://aotrc.weebly.com/) didn't exist either.
- [Order](https://github.com/aelariane) ([Anarchy](https://github.com/aelariane/Anarchy)-related features)
- [Elite Future/Kevin](https://github.com/kkim6109) ([Voice Chat for PUN](https://github.com/kkim6109/Mic-Integration-Old-Photon-))
- Fleur/Syal, Esli, Bahaa, Edz, and \[too\] many annoying players for helping me test my anti-abuse code.
- [Sadico](https://github.com/Mi-Sad), I've probably asked you for something at some point.
- [Mr. Lurkin](https://github.com/MrLurkin), [Zippy](https://github.com/ZippyStew45), [Alice](https://github.com/ExiMichi), and many more for ideas of what to add.
- Akiroshy, Milk, Lilim, and a multitude of users for giving me motivation to keep the project going.
