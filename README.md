# Guardian
A free, open-source, and feature-rich modification for the Attack on Titan Tribute Game.

## Where can I download Guardian Mod?
Download and run "[Paradis.exe](https://aottg.winnpixie.com/clients/guardian/Paradis.exe)" to start playing!
    - If Windows Smart Defender stops Paradis from opening, click "More Info", and then click "Run Anyway". This is an issue I will not fix, as I do not sign the executable.

## Features
This mod has (almost) everything RiceCake's mod (RC mod) has, and much more!

- Improved protection against abusive users!
- A much needed face-lift for the in-game user-interface.
- In-game Voice Chat!
    - `V` to talk, baskslash (`\`) to open the configuration menu.
- Custom textures and sounds!
    - Help regarding custom assets are in the `README.txt` file after downloading the game.
- A plethora of new settings (ESCAPE key to open the configuration menu)
    - View ALL of them at [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md)
- New Gamemodes
    - **Time-Bomb** - Kill titans to gain time and stay alive!
    - **Last Man Standing** - The last player with the most kills after each wave wins!
    - **Cage Fight** - Two players, two titans, each titan kill causes the opposing side to have another titan that they need to kill. Whoever dies first loses.
        - A ground-up re-creation of Feng's Cage Fight gamemode that had been long gone.
- New Map Options (requires Guardian to host or join, excluding Anarchy-Custom)
    - **The City II** (The City with 10s Respawn)
    - **The City IV** (The Forest II, but in The City)
    - **The City V** (The Forest III, but in The City)
    - **Multi-Map** (Allows you to change the map while in a room)
    - **Anarchy-Custom Map** (Custom Maps with support for Anarchy's racing objects and scripts)
- Notable and/or Technical Changes
    - Ability to switch between a UDP or TCP connection to [Photon](https://photonengine.com/)
    - The "Quickmatch" button now acts as a way to enter "Offline Mode"
